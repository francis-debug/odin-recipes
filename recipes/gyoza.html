        <h2>Description</h2>
            These Japanese dumplings get their distinctive softness and crunch from a combination of 
            frying and steaming. Gyoza come filled with a variety of meats and vegetables, but we'll be
            using a traditional mix of ground pork, cabbage, and shiitake mushrooms. 
            This recipe comes from <a href='https://www.justonecookbook.com/gyoza/'>Just One Cookbook.</a>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h4>Making the Filling</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>After you open the gyoza wrappers, make sure to cover them under a damp towel or plastic wrap so they don't dry out.</li>
                    <li>As cabbage leaves are thick and hard, we use different ways to wilt them. You can blanch or microwave the leaves for a minute or two. You can also sprinkle them with salt to dehydrate the cabbage, then squeeze the water out. Or you can skip the entire process altogether. </li>
                    <li>Discard the thick core of the cabbage leaves; mince the leaves into very small pieces.</li> 
                    <li>Mince the green onions and shiitake mushrooms into small pieces.</li> 
                    <li>Combine the ground meat, cabbage, green onions, and shiitake mushrooms in a large bowl.</li> 
                    <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add the seasonings to the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Mix well and knead the mixture with your hand until it becomes pale in color and sticky.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Folding the Gyoza</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it in the center with your fingers, but don’t seal it yet. </li>
                    <li>Using the thumb and index finger of your right hand, start making a pleat about once every ¼ inch (6 mm) on the top part of the wrapper from the center toward the right side, making 3-4 pleats. Tip: As you fold each pleat, press the folded pleat tightly against the back part of the wrapper using your left thumb and index finger. </li>
                    <li>Continue with the left side of the gyoza, making 3-4 pleats with your left hand, starting in the center and moving toward the left side.</li>
                    <li>Press the pleats and shape the gyoza. Repeat folding the remaining wrappers.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Cooking</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, place the gyoza in a single layer, flat side down in a circular pattern (or place them in two columns).</li>
                    <li>Cook until the bottom of the gyoza turns golden brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add ¼ cup of water to the pan. Immediately cover with a lid and steam the gyoza for about 3 minutes or until most of the water evaporates.</li>
                    <li>Remove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. Drizzle 1 tsp sesame oil around the gyoza in the frying pan.</li>
                    <li>Cook uncovered until the gyoza is golden brown and crisp on the bottom. </li>
                    <li>Transfer to a plate and serve with the dipping sauce. For the dipping sauce, combine the sauce ingredients in a small plate and mix together. </li>
                    <li>Storage: You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for a month.</li>
                </ol>
